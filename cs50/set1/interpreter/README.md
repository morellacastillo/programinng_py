Here is a step-by-step explanation of the script:
The user is prompted to enter an expression in the form of "x y z" where x and z are integers and y is an operation symbol (+, -, *, /). The input is stored in the variable expression.
The line x, y, z = expression.split(" ") splits the input expression into separate values for x, y, and z using the space character as a separator.
The interpreter() function is defined. It checks the value of y and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation on x and z if y is one of the supported operations (+, -, *, /). If y is / and z is equal to 0, the function outputs the string "Invalid syntax" and returns None. Otherwise, the function returns the result of the operation rounded to one decimal place using the round() function.
The line result = interpreter() calls the interpreter() function and stores the returned result in the variable result.
The line if result is not None: checks if the value of result is not None. If result is not None, the line print("Result:", result) outputs the result to the console.
So, the script takes an expression as input, performs the corresponding arithmetic operation and returns the result, rounded to one decimal place. If the operation is not supported or if it would result in a division by zero, the script outputs "Invalid syntax".

me: what does it mean 
    print("Invalid syntax")
            return None
        return round(r, 1)

The print("Invalid syntax") statement is executed when the operation specified by y is not one of the supported operations +, -, *, or / or when y is / and z is equal to 0. This line outputs the string "Invalid syntax" to the console.
The return None statement immediately exits the function and returns the value None.
The return round(r, 1) statement returns the value of r rounded to one decimal place. The round() function takes two arguments: the value to round, and the number of decimal places to round to. In this case, r is rounded to one decimal place.
